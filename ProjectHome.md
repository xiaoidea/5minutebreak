<h2>Prepare for break</h2>

Five minutes before break a tooltip in system tray will popup, this is so you can prepare for the real break, so when it comes you will go away from computer immediately, with no excuses of like "But I need 5 more minutes!". During this 5 minutes before break you have enough time to save your current tasks and finish any chat conversations.<br>

<h2>Alarm message</h2>

Alarm pops up in full screen and shows you a big message "Stand up and make a 5 minute break away from your computer! Otherwise your eyes and body will hurt..." along with a red countdown timer of 5 minutes, see screenshot below:<br>
